# Introduction to Web3, Blockchain, and Python.

Hello, and welcome!:)

My name is abc0xmattyic333, I am going to be your mentor and developer advocate throughout this small tutorial.

In this course we are going to use Alchemy, Web3.py, and Python to connect to Ethereum and other EVM's to read some on-chain data.

So if you like programming, are interested in getting into Web3, then stick around and follow this course.
